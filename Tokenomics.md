Tokenomics Breakdown
Gabby Token’s unique tax system ensures sustainable growth, rewards for holders, and reduced supply:

Transaction Tax: A total of 3% on every buy or transfer (no sell tax applied):

1% Burn: Sent to the Dead Address (0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD), permanently removing it from circulation.

1% Market Wallet: Allocated for CEX listings and community development.

Market Wallet Address: 0x3c9666f7BA4EFf024fa8E79bCFfbBd330c13d6CA

1% Holder Rewards: Automatically distributed to all Gabby holders, incentivizing long-term participation.

No Sell Tax Policy
To foster trust and transparency within the community, Gabby Token has removed any sell tax. This decision ensures a fair and open environment for token holders, encouraging long-term holding and community engagement without penalizing selling activity. This unique approach aligns with our core philosophy of empowering the community.

Deflationary Mechanism
Every transaction contributes to reducing the token supply:

Burn Address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD

Tokens sent to this address are irretrievable and permanently removed from circulation.

This deflationary model creates a supply shock over time, increasing both the value and demand for Gabby.

Market Wallet Usage
The market wallet plays a vital role in Gabby Token’s growth and adoption:

Funding for CEX listings.

Supporting marketing campaigns.

Community development and collaborations.

Note: The market wallet is not exempt from transaction tax, ensuring alignment with the community-first principle.
